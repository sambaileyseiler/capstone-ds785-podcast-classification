If you've listened, you may recognize DJ Envy’s voice. He’s here today with his partner Cesar Pina, to talk real estate, seminars, and business. DJ Envy grew up in Queens, New York, and was neighbors with a successful DJ.

After buying his first house and later selling it due to a long commute, Envy walked away with around $80,000. He was hooked, and knew that real estate was a long-term way for him to build his wealth and create success for him and his family. He started out buying a house every year and selling it a year later, then bought some homes in Detroit for $15,000 that sold for over $260,000! Envy wanted to get more into real estate, so he was introduced to Cesar. Cesar was serving time in prison when he first learnt about real estate investing. Once he was released, he decided to jump in. He bought single family homes, then small multifamily homes, then went on to commercial buildings. Now, heowns more than 1,600 units and flips anywhere from 60 to 80 houses per year! His new book, Flipping Keys, comes out later this month.

Rachel Richards, real estate investor, agent, and author of Money Honey shares her story of aggressive real estate acquisition. All purchased, by the way, with at least 20% down! While her friends in high school may have been reading for fun, Rachel was reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and trying to find the best way to become financially free. After she graduated from college she took jobs where she felt underappreciated and at some points, humiliated. She realized that this was not the path she would go down, and started investing shortly after in 2017. By 2018, Rachel and her husband had acquired 38 doors. Yes, you heard that right, 38 doors in under two years! These rental properties allowed Rachel and her husband to retire, as they were making six-figure incomes solely from their properties alone. This didn’t mean two years in she was still a rookie. Far from it actually. Rachel had to systematize her rental properties as much as she could within those two years so she could manage them long distance without having huge headaches along the way. Rachel shares some interesting stories, from turning a duplex into a short-term boarding home, to catching her property managers stealing over $6,000 from her. She’s learnt a lot and put her knowledge into her books Money Honey and Passive Income, Aggressive Retirement, both of which may help you get to where she’s at now!

Steve was actually an engineer at Intel before he made the leap to become an agent. As luck would have it, Steve got in right as the market was about to tank in 2007/2008. Did this stop him from finding success? Of course not! Steve was interested in real estate, and after finding out what agents did for a living, he knew he needed to make a career switch. He left his corporate job and headed into real estate, trying to get any leads he could as an agent. His prior employer, Intel, told him that he was welcomed back if he ever needed a job, but when he tried to come back a couple years later, they didn’t have a position available for him. He knew the bridge was burnt, and it was time for him to go full throttle on real estate. Now, a decade or so later, Steve is teaching his tips and tricks to aspiring agents, wholesalers, and de al finders alike.

We often see people bragging about how they work 60 hour weeks, work on weekends, or spend the most time at the office or in front of their computer. Does this constant overworking actually accomplish something or is it more of a chest-beating competition? Michael Hyatt argues that working crazy hours rarely does anything for our productivity, and if anything, can make our work sluggish and dull. He should know, in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as teams were working more than ever from home, Michael decided to do the opposite. Michael lowered his (and his team’s) working hours from 40 hours a week, to 30 hours a week. The result? A profit increase of nearly 100% and company-wide productivity boost. Not only does your work quality benefit, but so do your relationships, your health, and your outlook on life when you are off of the “grind mode”. Michael believes this so much that he wrote a book about it. Win at Work and Succeed at Life goes through what Michael calls the “double win”: winning at life and work, with no tradeoffs! Michael lists a handful of ways you can instantly improve your work/life balance.

At some point, all of us were. How do you make sure you’re getting a great deal, how should you pay for it, and what can you do to make sure it’s a purchase that will help you grow your wealth. In today’s episode, you’ll hear from Scott Trench and Mindy Jensen, hosts of the BiggerPockets Money Show. Their new book, First-Time Home Buyer, shows how to buy your first property in a way that sets you up for long-term success. Most people see their primary home as an investment, but that isn’t usually the truth. Housing is a cost, and like many costs in life, we should try to minimize it when we can. Having a lower housing cost can allow you to invest more of your money, build up safety reserves for repairs, and have the financial bandwidth to live with less stress. Scott and Mindy debate cash flow vs appreciation, how much you should put down on your home, and what kind of liquidity position you need to be in to find success in your purchase and future endeavors. Even if you’re not looking to build a rental empire, this is a fantastic book for anyone who is looking into buying for the first time.

Once distracted, our brains find it hard to let go of the new information we’ve just learnt or seen. This is why the constant onslaught of emails, messages, texts, and phone calls could be killing our productivity and creativity. Cal Newport, author of A World Without Email, has seen this first hand. Cal discusses something he likes to call “Hyperactive Hivemind Workflow”, which is essentially what happens to our brains when we’re constantly being nudged by electronic messages. When you’ve got your head down and are working hard on an important project, just a simple glance at an email can spin everything out of whack. Here’s the thing, this is happening to all of us, all the time. We are constantly monitoring our emails and messages, and by the mid afternoon, we’re out of energy. We’ve exhausted all of our cognitive resources. But isn’t it productive to check emails and respond to them quickly throughout the day? This is what Cal refers to as the “fool’s gold of busyness”. Luckily, there are some ways to get us into a more productive state, without having a barrage of emails in our inbox. Cal talks about efficient meetings, Kanban boards, restricting ad hoc communication, having office hours, and being intentional with your time and attention. While these small email responses may seem like just a minute here or a minute there, they actually eat up a huge part of our work life. In This Episode We Cover: Why we need to limit our intake of email, messages, and other communication throughout the day Getting your team to be less ad hoc about communication and more intentional Having a “process and procedure first” mindset when starting a business Understanding what the “vital tasks” are in your businessKnowing your cognizant footprint and having intentional attention And So Much More!",no,Education

As the title of today’s episode suggests, we’re going to talk about three big takeaways from happiness research. One has to do with breathing exercises.

One of my most important role models here has been John Biewen, host of a podcast called Scene on Radio. The show has had four seasons, but the seasons that have most impacted me are Seasons 2 and 3. Season 2 is called “Seeing White,” in which he explores white people and whiteness. Season 3 is called “Men,” in which he looks at sexism.

    ","Health & Fitness, Mental Health, Self-Help, Spirituality",The Profound Upside of Self-Diminishment | George Saunders,"There is a powerful scene in a novel called Lincoln In the Bardo, where President Abraham Lincoln has come to the cemetery where his young son, Willie, is soon to be buried. Willie had passed away at the White House where he had gotten sick. Lincoln is so distraught that he goes to the graveyard to get one last glimpse at his boy’s dead body. As the President is leaving, and in the grips of perhaps the worst psychic pain available to any human, he has an insight. His suffering, he realizes, comes from viewing his son as solid, when, in fact, they are both just “energy bursts” or “two passing temporarinesses.” There is a reason this insight will be familiar to anyone with a passing familiarity with Buddhism, and that is because the author, George Saunders, is a practicing Buddhist. Lincoln in the Bardo won the 2017 Man Booker Prize for best work of fiction in English. Saunders has written ten other books, including the newly released A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, which is about how to become a better reader and that can tell us about how to live. This was an enormously valuable conversation for me, both as a meditator and as an author (because he has many, deeply useful thoughts about the craft). We talk about many things here, including: the “unified theory of brain,” how writing resembles meditation, his speculations about the afterlife, and a speech he gave on kindness that went viral.",no,Health

Most store-bought dog and cat foods consist of low-quality meats, fillers and preservatives. Our four-legged friends are our family, and they deserve better. Welcome to Fatal Conveniences™ This is a bite-sized segment that parallels The Darin Olien Show. In these segments, we get into society's Fatal Conveniences™. I define these as the things we may be doing because the world we live in makes us believe we have to. These things save us time and trick us into thinking they're actually good for us. But it's those same things that are breaking down our health, and the health of the environment around us. I've spent most of my adult life obsessively researching these ""conveniences."" On every show, I pick one topic, and we dive into it. My goal is to make you more aware of these traps so that you can push back on them. Remember, it starts with you and the choices you make. So, if you're willing to look at your world from a different perspective and make little tweaks that amount to big changes, then this segment is for you. Pet diseases have increased 80% in the last fifty years. When most of the store-bought pet foods on the market are filled with junk, it’s not very hard to figure out why. Pet food manufacturers are constantly trying to make the food making process cheaper. So that means cheap ingredients and cheap packaging. All of that results in poor nutritional health for your furry friends. This one isn’t tough, guys. We need to make sure our pets are eating whole, nutritional foods. I choose a plant-based diet for myself, but I know a vegan diet isn’t best for my German Shepherd, Chaga. So I give him a fresh, mostly raw diet consisting of 75% meat and 25% veggies and ancient grains. I’ll give you some tips on how to use fresh food for your dog and some fresh pet food companies that I love. Our pets are our babies, so let’s make sure we’re giving them the best life possible.

So, if you're willing to look at your world from a different perspective and make little tweaks that amount to big changes, then this segment is for you. Americans spend $200 Million on Lip Balm and Chapstick every year. You probably have some lip balm within arm’s reach right now. You can find tubes of lip balm in every bathroom, nightstand, kitchen junk drawer, purse and jacket pocket of pretty much every American household. We’ve been obsessively buying this stuff for almost a century. We think it helps moisturize the sensitive skin on and around our lips, but does it? The truth is, layering waxy substances on your lips creates a moisture barrier. So although they may feel soft and moisturized, you’re preventing your body’s natural process of shedding dead skin and creating new, healthy cells. Then when your lip balm or chapstick wears off, your lips feel dry, and you apply more. This essentially stops your lips from regenerating new skin. You need to let those lips breathe! But hey, I know certain conditions call for some sort of protection or healing for your lips. But you need to be aware of which ingredients are going to do more damage than good. I’ll give you some healthy, safe alternatives, as well as tips for things you can do to keep your lips moisturized naturally. So, ditch that Cherry ChapStick, guys, and listen up.
